Let's Organise is a collaborative resource designed to help people get whatever they have to spare to those in need. No matter how much or little you have to share, this tool will help you to get your time and money to the right places quickly, effectively and easily, enabling each of us to take responsibility for each other under a government refusing to do so.

We are offering an uncomplicated and trustworthy introduction to social organising. Our resources will help connect you to existing initiatives, connect you to other activists, and suggest ways to protect and care for yourself during organisation, volunteering, and/or protest.

If you are an individual looking for ways to get involved, first decide how much time you have to spare. We wil then offer you options for ways to use that time to help someone - whether it's through donations, offering physical work or adding your voice to government consultations.

If you are an organisation or group in need of resources, please contact us and we will help broadcast your message, or integrate your project into the site.
