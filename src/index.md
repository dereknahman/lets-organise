Here's some test text that Kirsty wrote because she ate too much chilli and got ants in her pants and thought she might get started on a new project. Hopefully someone who is more talented with words can step in and provide some copy eventually because every time Kirsty thinks about the GE she bursts into tears and has to eat more chilli.

Something from git for an extra test. Oi Oi.
